Hello there! #speaker: SkullDude

===main===
This will test the tag system in Ink, by attaching a speaker name and a portrait for the character. Got it?
    *Yes
        Fantasic!
    *Not really
        It's simple! We'll use tags that let's the code call upon different thing in your project! For now, it is only setting the NPCs name, but we can explore more.
                **Oh ok.
                
-Fantastic! nice talking to you.
