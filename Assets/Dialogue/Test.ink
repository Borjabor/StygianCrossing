=== main === 
With this update, the text is now typing itself out at a constant (editable) speed. As long as its contents are being filled, the options and "continue" button will be hidden from the player. They may click the little arrow below to finish the text instantly if they so wish (so impatient). I'll add more random words here just so you can test it out without missing any other possible important bits I'll talk about. Text dialogue, blah blah blah, hello my darling, hello my honey, hello my ragtime gaaaaaallll!! Ok, I think this should be enough, let's move one?
    + <color=\#9A330B>All right</color>
        -> RichText
    + <color=\#9A330B>No, I wanna see that again</color>
        -> main
        
=== RichText ===
We can also now add rich text tags to change <color=\#005500>color</color> or effect, like <b>BOLD</b> or <i>italic</i> text, so we can add emphasis on specific parts of the dialogue.

Ok. These are the changes for now. Thanks for listening (reading, actually) to my TED talk.
